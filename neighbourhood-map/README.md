To successfully run the app you need to have an internet connection
If your screen is too small to fit both the map and the list, the list will be hidden.
To show it you just need to clock the ">" button. Don't worry about the map,
it will appear back when you will hide the list. To hide it and show back the map
you just need to click the "<" button. Have fun!

As the project is quite old, and google maps is not a free API anymore,
then it'll throw many errors and show a bad looking "only for development" mode.
Not to worry, besides the popups and display mode, the page is working entirely correctly.
