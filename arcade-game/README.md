To run the game your browser should be able to run canvas.
You should open index.html.
Your goal is to reach the second side of the road and the river, and step on the grass.
Watch out for the bugs, they will kill you. Also, avoid the water. To cross the river step on the moving planks.
Use arrow keys to move your player.
As the game starts, the time starts, so hurry, the clock is ticking.
After each win the bugs go a bit faster and you have slightly less time, so the chalange is bigger. When you lose, the bugs go slower and the time is longer.
Your goal is to reach 5 wins (and of course not to reach 5 loses). After that the game ends. Refresh the browser window to play again!!!
